# Password Generator

This is the challenge for week 3 of the Boot Camp which focused mainly on the JS functionality of a page. This README file inclues a brief summary of the changes made by Cyprian Gomes as part of getting the password generator to work.

**NOTE**: The `index.html` and `style.css` files were provided by the Boot Camp. Very minor changes were made in the `index.html` which are detailed below.

The password generator can be accessed at https://capg84.github.io/password-generator/

## Changes made to the script.js file

* Added a `prompt` to allow the user to set the length of the password. Validation is implemented to check that input is a number between 0-9, and the length is between 8 and 128.

* Created variables to define the character sets

* Added four prompts using the `confirm` method to define the password criteria

* Added a check at the end that at least one type of character is selected.

## Changes made to the index.html file

* Changed one div from `<div>` to `<main>`.

* Changed the text under `div class="card-heard"` to `Generate your strong password`
